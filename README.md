# embedded-vehicle-mgmt
An embedded solution to e-governance and vehicle management on the road.  
college project for final year in MIT, Manipal    
  
This project is meant to run on the ESP32 using the arduino IDE. It uses embedded sensors like Ultrasonic distance sensor (SR04), Real Time Clock (DS3231) and a GSM+GPS module (SIM808) along with Blynk.io to achieve communication between 2 ESP32s. This projects measures speed of vehicles, parking status and overspeeding. For more information, the final year project report pdf is uploaded to /project_pdf if you are interested to read the whole project.
  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                
This page is a place to keep all the source code files related to this project. This includes the final 2 files (for 2 microcontrollers) and the practice and test sketches used before to achieve the final result. These files are not organised well or named very appropriately. The code isnt well commented on. This project was made much before it was uploaded to github so please excuse all these shortcomings, as this is also my first public upload here
